# SpotOn Backend Implementation Planning

## Project Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for the SpotOn backend system, organized by implementation phases for maximum tracking efficiency.

### 🎯 **Three Core Features**
1. **Multi-View Person Detection**: Identifies and locates individuals within each camera frame independently
2. **Cross-Camera Re-Identification and Tracking**: Matches and tracks individuals across different camera views, maintaining persistent identity using visual features
3. **Unified Spatial Mapping**: Transforms detected locations onto a common 2D map coordinate system for visualizing continuous trajectories
